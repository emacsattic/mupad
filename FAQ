(1) Does these scripts work with xemacs ? 
    Not yet.

(2) How to replace xmupad by emacs + mupad-run.el ?

    use the following trivial script:
    -----------------------------------------------
    #!/bin/sh -f
    emacs -f run-mupad &
    -----------------------------------------------
    You simply need to make a text file (say mymupad),
    copy the above two lines and make it executable
    by "chmod 755 mymupad". And then create an icon
    on your desktop or your menubar to start this
    executable. If you are under windows, get linux ...
    No, get cygwin, it should be enough or ask
    a windows forum how to achieve that.

(3) How do I tell emacs that files ending with .MU are MuPAD files?

    Add the following to your .emacs file:
    (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.MU$" . mupad-mode) auto-mode-alist))

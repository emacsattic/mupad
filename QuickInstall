Quick installation procedure
============================

In short, this package uses the standard installation procedure:
unpacking, ./configure, make, make check, make install. This file
describes this with some more details. See the file INSTALL for
generic information on the use of configure.

1.  Unpacking:

	gunzip mupacs-*.tar.gz
	tar xvf mupacs-*.tar
	cd mupacs-*/

2.  Configuration:

	./configure

    If configure does not find MuPAD, or if you want to override the
    default location, you can use something like:

	./configure MUPAD=mupad2

    Here is the complete list of variables you can override:

	MUPAD:		MuPAD itself
			Default: mupad
	MUPADdir:	The root directory of MuPAD (i.e. MUPAD_ROOT_PATH)
	MUPADbindir:	The directory containing MuPAD's programs
			Default: $MUPADdir/share/bin

3.  Compilation

	make

4.  Tests:

	make check

    Actually, there is no testsuite yet ...

5. Installation:

	make install

    By default mupacs gets installed in /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp

    If emacs is installed in /usr/bin/emacs, you may need to install
    mupacs in /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp instead:

	configure --prefix=/usr

    Type 'configure --help' for details.

6. Usage:

    Start emacs. If the installation went properly, mupacs should be
    directly available by autoload.

    To start mupad inside emacs: M-x mupad-run
    To change the major mode of a buffer to MuPAD: M-x mupad-mode
    To customize mupacs: M-x customize-group mupad

7. Getting help:

8.  That's all folks!

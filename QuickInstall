Quick installation procedure
============================

Unix, including Darwin:
-----------------------

In short, this package uses the standard installation procedure:
unpacking, ./configure, make, make check, make install. This file
describes this with some more details. Depending on your architecture
you may also just install prebuild packages; in this case you may skip
directly to section 6 below.

See the file INSTALL for generic information on the use of configure.

Note: you can install mupacs in your own account if you don't have
root access. See --prefix and lispdir options below.


1.  Unpacking:

	gunzip mupacs-*.tar.gz
	tar xvf mupacs-*.tar
	cd mupacs-*/

2.  Configuration:

	./configure

    If configure does not find MuPAD, or if you want to override the
    default location, you can use something like:

	./configure MUPAD=mupad2

    Here is the complete list of variables you can override:

	MUPAD:		MuPAD itself
			Default: mupad
	MUPADdir:	The root directory of MuPAD (i.e. MUPAD_ROOT_PATH)
	MUPADbindir:	The directory containing MuPAD's programs
			Default: $MUPADdir/share/bin
	lispdir:	The directory where to install the lisp files
			Default: /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/

3.  Compilation

	make

4.  Tests:

	make check

    Actually, there is no testsuite yet. Shame on us.

5. Installation:

	make install

    By default mupacs gets installed in /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/

    If emacs is installed in /usr/bin/emacs, it is recommended to
    install mupacs in /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp instead:

	configure --prefix=/usr

    Type 'configure --help' for details.

6. Testing the installation:

    Start emacs, and open a file ending with .mu. If mupacs was
    installed at the default place, and the installation went
    properly, mupacs should load automatically.

    Otherwise, just add the following line to your ~/.emacs file, or
    to the site-wide emacs initialization file (typically
    /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/site-start.el, or
    /etc/emacs/site-start.el on Linux Mandrake):

	(load "<path-to-mupacs>/site-start.d/mupacs.el")


7. Usage:

    To change the major mode of a buffer to MuPAD: M-x mupad-mode
    To start mupad inside emacs:		   M-x mupad-run
    To customize mupacs: 			   M-x customize-group mupad

    After this stage, usage should be essentially
    self-explanatory: explore! You may obtain further information
    by browsing the mode descriptions with M-x describe-mode inside
    the MuPAD buffers. This contains in particular some tips on how to
    configure MuPAD for advanced features (plots, ...).

    You may also wish to consult the files mupad.el-info and
    mupad-run.el-info. However, beware that some parts of their
    content are in French and/or slightly outdated.

8. Getting help:

    For support in French, send an e-mail to mupad@aful.org.
    Otherwise, send an e-mail to mupacs-users@lists.sourceforge.net.

9.  That's all folks!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Windows:
--------

MuPACS has not been tested *at all* under windows. From now on, you are
on your own. Please report any positive or negative experience!

Obviously, you need to have emacs installed first. Then, unpack the
content of mupacs-<version>.tar.gz wherever you like; typically:

	<emacsdir>\site-lisp\mupacs\

Copy the file

	<emacsdir>\site-lisp\mupacs\site-start.d/mupad.el.in.in

to

	<emacsdir>\site-lisp\site-start.d\mupad.el

Edit this file and replace all occurences of @MuPADdir@ and @lispdir@
by whatever is appropriate; typically:

	@MuPADdir@ =>  C:\Program Files\Sciface\MuPAD Pro 3.1.0\
	@lispdir@  =>  <emacsdir>\site-lisp\mupacs\).

Start emacs, and open a file blah.mu in a buffer. The buffer should
automatically turn to mupad-mode, and do syntax highlighting and the
like. Recall that mupad-run will certainly not work.

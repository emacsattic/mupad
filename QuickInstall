Quick installation procedure
============================

In short, this package uses the standard installation procedure:
unpacking, ./configure, make, make check, make install. This file
describes this with some more details. See the file INSTALL for
generic information on the use of configure.

Note: you can install mupacs in your own account if you don't have
root access. See --prefix and lispdir options below.


1.  Unpacking:

	gunzip mupacs-*.tar.gz
	tar xvf mupacs-*.tar
	cd mupacs-*/

2.  Configuration:

	./configure

    If configure does not find MuPAD, or if you want to override the
    default location, you can use something like:

	./configure MUPAD=mupad2

    Here is the complete list of variables you can override:

	MUPAD:		MuPAD itself
			Default: mupad
	MUPADdir:	The root directory of MuPAD (i.e. MUPAD_ROOT_PATH)
	MUPADbindir:	The directory containing MuPAD's programs
			Default: $MUPADdir/share/bin
	lispdir:	The directory where to install the lisp files
			Default: /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/

3.  Compilation

	make

4.  Tests:

	make check

    Actually, there is no testsuite yet. Shame on us.

5. Installation:

	make install

    By default mupacs gets installed in /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/

    If emacs is installed in /usr/bin/emacs, it's recommended to
    install mupacs in /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp instead:

	configure --prefix=/usr

    Type 'configure --help' for details.

6. Testing the installation:

    Start emacs, and open a file ending with .mu. If mupacs was
    installed at the default place, and the installation went
    properly, mupacs should load automatically.

    Otherwise, just add the following line to your ~/.emacs file, or
    to the site-wide emacs initialization file (typically
    /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/site-start.el, or
    /etc/emacs/site-start.el on Linux Mandrake):

	(load "<path-to-mupacs>/site-start.d/mupacs.el>")


7. Usage:

    To change the major mode of a buffer to MuPAD: M-x mupad-mode
    To start mupad inside emacs:		   M-x mupad-run
    To customize mupacs: 			   M-x customize-group mupad

    After this stage, usage should be essentially
    self-explanatory. So, explore, and see the files mupad.el-info and
    mupad-run.el-info when you want to know more precise things.

8. Getting help:

    For support in French, send an e-mail to mupad@aful.org.
    Otherwise, contact directly the authors (see file AUTHORS)

9.  That's all folks!

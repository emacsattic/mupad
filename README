General information
===================

Name		: mupacs
Version		: 3.2.3
Summary		: mupacs -- a MuPAD mode for emacs
License		: GPL
Vendor:		: Nicolas M. Thiéry <nthiery@users.sourceforge.net>
URL		: http://mupacs.sourceforge.net/
Requires	: 
Description	:
mupacs is an open-source MuPAD mode for the text editor emacs.
Features:
 - Syntax highlighting and automatic indentation of MuPAD code;
 - Running MuPAD in a buffer with full access to the documentation
   and debugger interaction.



Requirements
============

GNU Emacs > 19.0 (or xemacs up to some glitches)

Obviously, the computer algebra system MuPAD is also required if you
want to run it inside emacs. This system is available in binary form
for many operating systems:

	http://www.mupad.de

Free licences for MuPAD are available for personnal use and (up to a
point) research; check the web page of Sciface for details:

	http://www.sciface.com

Using the lastest version of MuPAD (currently 2.5.3) is recommended.
With MuPAD 2.0.0 some features won't work properly (debugger). With
older version, most features won't work.

The code itself is written in Emacs lisp, and should be
portable. However, we have only tested it under UNIX (including MacOS
X), and with MuPAD light. The interaction with MuPAD in mupad-run uses
the so-called raw protocol which is probably not implemented in MuPAD
light for Windows; so, this part won't work. Please report any
positive or negative experience with other systems, or older versions
of emacs.


Download and Installation
=========================

mupacs is distributed on the web page (see above) in precompiled
RPMs (GNU/linux i386), source RPMs and source code. The latest
development version can be obtained from the CVS repository (see
below).

The installation from source code follows the usual scheme configure /
make / make install. See the file 'INSTALL' for generic instructions
and 'QuickInstall' for a brief summary.

We strongly recomment that you join the users mailing list:

Notes for the maintainer
========================

The configure script is generated by automake/autoconf. You need
automake >= 1.5c and autoconf >= 2.52. Here is the sequence of
commands to recompile fully from scratch:

	make maintainer-clean
	rm -f config.cache configure
	./bootstrap
	./configure --enable-maintainer-mode --config-cache
	make
	make check
	make install

Creating a new release
----------------------

Update the files configure.ac, NEWS and ChangeLog, rerun bootstrap as
above, and issue:

	make release

==============================================================================
Notes for the developers
========================

Getting the latest version from the CVS repository:
---------------------------------------------------

Anonymous CVS read-only access:

	cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.mupacs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/mupacs login 
	cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.mupacs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/mupacs co mupacs

When prompted for a password for anonymous, simply press the Enter key.


Developer CVS access via SSH:

Only project developers can access the CVS tree via this method. SSH1
must be installed on your client machine. Substitute developername
with the proper value. Enter your site password when prompted.

	export CVS_RSH=ssh 
 	cvs -z3 -d:ext:developername@cvs.mupacs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/mupacs co mupacs

Once checked out, the rest of the configuration and installation is as
usual (./configure ...). Later on, you just need to run `cvs update -d`
in the mupacs directory to update to the latest version.
